<h2>About this site</h2>
<p>
Welcome! 
</p>
<p>
This is the personal website of Stefano Gombi, a pretty cool guy from Italy.
</p>
<p>
    It's a place where I'm free to express my opinions and to suggests interesting resources, 
    often regarding software design and production.
</p>
<p>
    This site serves also as an exercise, as it forces me to improve myself under several aspects:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>to put my thoughts in order, instead of leaving them the messy chaos they usually are;</li>
    <li>to improve my written english (don't laugh) by trying to write correctly and to learn new words;</li>
    <li>to struggle against my perfectionism, who would have required years of work on little details,
        making this site never see the light.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Opinions expressed are my own and they must not be taken too seriously. I hope to
    gain much more experience in life: probably I'll learn more about what I'm writing
    today, and maybe my opinions will be different in the future. Things will change.
</p>
<p>
    Even technically, this site is an expression of my opinions and an exercise. 
    It's built to be simple, to give a sense of order, and to be easily understandable.
    Also, I've forced myself to publish it when it was completely under construction, with
    not even posts' pagination, or this page; all this in order to demonstrate to myself that
    no-one would have laughed at me for not having much time to work on this. I hope that, at
    the time you're reading this text, things look more complete.
</p>

<h2>About me</h2>
<p>
    As I said earlier, I'm a pretty cool guy from Reggio Emilia - Italy born in 1990. 
    I got my first job as a web developer when I was 16 and I'm still doing this job today. 
    Lately, I'm learning about interaction design and usability to improve the quality 
    of the software I produce.
</p>
<p>
    I like to garden, read, get lost in nature. Wow, that sounds boring once written.

    You can contact me ad dumaron[at]gmail.com, but since I'm trying to remove superfluous things
    from my life I can't assure I'll reply to you. Don't take it personally.
