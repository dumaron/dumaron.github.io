After a couple of curses while trying to make a web UI more interface at work, I leared about the `svh` unit on StackOverflow. After that, a colleague of mine suggestes `dvh` too, so it was time for me to discover these new units. I mean, I've heard about them in the past, but I never had the change to dig into them enough.

This video was particularly useful to learn precisely what they do and when to use them. The guy is cool, might be good to follow him.

I ended up using `dvh`, even though it's not what is suggested in the video. The end result was better, but there's probably something I still don't understand.
